{\bfseries PAPER}

Aronow, P.M. \& Samil, C. (2016). ``\href{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12185/abstract}{Does Regression Produce
Representative Estimates of Causal Effects?}'' {\itshape American Journal of
Political Science}, 60(1), p. 250-267. doi:10.1111/ajps.12185

{\bfseries From Dale Ballou:}

Here is the answer to the question I raised at our last meeting.

To refresh your memory, here is the question.  The article pointed out
that a least-squares estimate of a treatment effect is a weighted
average of individual responses to treatment, with weights determined
by the residual of a regression of treatment on the other covariates
in the model.  The conclusion the authors drew was that this weighted
average may not represent the quantity in which we are interested.  In
particular, it may not be an unbiased estimate of the population mean
response to treatment.

The footnote that puzzled me discussed the random coefficient model in
the context of panel data.  The primary purpose of the footnote was to
discuss what happened when there was within-group heterogeneity in the
response to treatment.  However, in the course of these remarks, the
authors noted that when there was within-group homogeneity (albeit
heterogeneity across groups), applying least-squares to the random
coefficient model yielded an unbiased estimate of the population mean
response to treatment.

My question was why this case wasn't identical to the one they
discussed throughout the rest of the article: why didn't heterogeneity
across groups produce the same kind of weighted average estimate of
response to treatment that would only fortuitously equal the average
response in the population?

Hereâ€™s the answer.  In the random coefficient model to which they were
alluding, the response to treatment of individual $i$ is $\beta_i = \beta + u_i$,
where $\beta$ is the population average and $u_i$ is the mean-zero deviation
of that individual from the population mean.  If responses are
homogeneous within groups, $u_i$ is the same for everyone in a group but
varies across groups.  It is assumed in this model that $u_i$ is
independent of the other covariates in the model.  The estimate of $\beta$
produced by the model is a weighted average of the $\beta_i$, in which the
weights are functions of the other covariates, $w_i = w(x_i)$.  Thus,
the resulting estimate of $\beta$ can be written as
\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta} &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\beta_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i},
\end{align*}

which has the same form as the estimated treatment effect discussed
elsewhere in the paper.  However, because $x_i$ is assumed independent
of $\beta_i$, so is $w_i$, so that when taking expectations of $\hat{\beta}$ with
respect to $u_i$, we get
\begin{align*}
E[\hat{\beta}] &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_iE[\beta_i]}{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_i}
                 = E[\beta_i] = \beta,
\end{align*}

{\itshape i.e.,} the population mean of $\beta_i$.

What's important to note is that the same argument applies to the
model discussed in the rest of the paper.  If individual responses to
treatment are independent of the covariates in the model, the
expectation of that estimate is not affected by the implied
reweighting, ({\itshape i.e.,} by the fact that the effective sample differs from
the notional sample).  All such samples yield unbiased estimates of
the population average response to treatment.  The re-weighting that
implicitly occurs is of no more consequence than the re-weighting that
obviously occurs when different random samples are drawn from the
population.  The differences in the estimated $\hat{\beta}$ are just sampling
noise.  However, $\hat{\beta}$ is a biased estimate of the treatment effect
when the $x$s are informative about individual heterogeneity.  That
appears to be the case the authors had in mind in the examples they
invited us to consider: cases where the effective sample is
non-representative.  But as I recall, they never made this condition
explicit, so that it was unclear why footnote 17 said one thing while
the rest of the article said another.
